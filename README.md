# Search Files Containing string "labex"

## Description
This project provides a simple script, `search_files.sh`, designed to search for all files in the `/etc` directory that contain the string "labex" in their content. The results are saved in a specified output file for easy reference.

## Usage
### Step 1: Ensure you have the necessary permissions
- The script uses `sudo` because it requires access to files in the `/etc` directory.
- You must have administrative privileges to run the script successfully.

### Step 2: Run the script
```bash
./search_files.sh
